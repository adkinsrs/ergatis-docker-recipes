# ergatis-docker-recipes
Recipes to build individual bioinformatics pipelines to use in Ergatis.  Each pipeline is located on its own particular branch.

Lateral Gene Transfer Pipeline (LGTSeek) -> branch 'lgtseek'
Transcriptomics Pipeline -> branch 'rnaseq'

UPDATE - Development of Dockerized pipelines will no longer occur on this repository.  They have been moved over to "IGS/<pipeline>_pipeline" and "IGS/<pipeline>_docker"
